# PratsLab - A Web-Based Code Playground

PratsLab is a clean, focused, and feature-rich code playground that runs entirely in your browser. Built with a modern IDE aesthetic, it provides a seamless environment for writing and testing both JavaScript and Python code without any backend setup. It saves your work locally and comes packed with themes and a flexible layout to match your workflow.
